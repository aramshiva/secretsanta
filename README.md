# Secret Santa Pairings
I was a community lead for the Hack Club's official Secret Santa event this Christmas! 
This was a blast to host and in this repository is the code for pairing! It's a rather complex algorthim where it prioritizes by country and then region.

This was made using simple JS, Airtable and Slack Bolt.
